This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(rgeos)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
ind <- raster::getData(name="GADM",country='GBR',level=0)
par(mai=c(0,0,0,0))
plot(ind)
```


```{r}
prj <- "+proj=tmerc +lat_0=49 +lon_0=-2 +k=0.9996012717 +x_0=400000 +y_0=-100000 +ellps=airy +datum=OSGB36 +units=m"
guk <- spTransform(ind, CRS(prj))
```

```{r}
disag = disaggregate(guk)
head(disag)
```
```{r}
a <- area(disag)
i <- which.max(a)

a[i]/1000000
```

```{r}
b <- disag[i,]
par(mai = rep(0,4))
plot(b)
```

```{r}
shapefile(b, filename='C:/Users/jaide/OneDrive/Desktop/qgis/gbr.shp')

```
